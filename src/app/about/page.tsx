              My name is Jakob Douglas, I'm 28 years old from Adelaide, South
              Australia and I enjoy learning how things work and then creating
              amazing things with this knowledge.

              Currently I work towards bettering my knowledge in the field of
              software engineering and building projects, working on self
              development skills and gaining new information within the
              industry. I create projects and test my knowledge and design
              process.

            <p className="text-md font-thin opacity-90">
              I have come from a varied background, from Hospitality and client
              management, dealing with a variety of teams and liaising with
              multiple organizations on and off sites to come together for a
              specific goal things such as project management and team
              development are not foreign to me. I have also had a vast history
              in travel and tourism, building and contracted work. This Mixture
              of backgrounds and workplaces has driven me to find new things and
              be the best I can at them, which has now led me to the software
              industry in which I am thoroughly enjoying and look forward to
              elevating my skills and knowledge even further in.
